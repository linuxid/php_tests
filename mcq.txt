The patient died of progressive heart failure. On autopsy: heart expanded in diameter, flabby; muscle in section of irregular blood supply, mottled; in histological examination in the myocardium, the anemia is completely diffuse, infiltrated mainly by lymphocytes and histiocytes.

Non-purulent intermediate myocarditis
Purulent intermediate myocarditis
Granulomatous myocarditis
Cardiosclerosis
Myocardial infarction

A 34 year old woman has perforation of hard palate. In the area of this perforation there was a compact well-defined formation. Microscopic examination of the resected formation revealed a large focus of caseous necrosis surrounded by granulation tissue with endovasculitis, cellular infiltration composed of lymphocytes, epithelioid cells (mainly plasmocytes). What is the most probable diagnosis?
Syphilis 
Scleroma
Leprosy
Sarcoma
Tuberculosis

In a patient who died of heart failure, pathomorphological examination revealed: the mitral valve cusps are deformed, thickened, fused at the edges; in the myocardial connective tissue, nodules are diffusely scattered, which consist of sections of fibrinoid necrosis, around which macrophagocytes that resemble giant multinuclear cells accumulate. Such foci are surrounded by lymphocytes and single plasma cells. Which of the following granulomas does this patient have?
rheumatic
tuberculous
actinomycotic
syphilitic
leprous
