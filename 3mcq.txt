A 61-year-old female suffers from an expressed deformity of joints of her fingers. Histologically, there are foci of fibrinoid necrosis, clusters of macrophages and areas of sclerosis in the periarticular connective tissue, the synovial cavity contains “ rice  bodies”. Make a diagnosis of the disease.

An examination of the 49-year-old female, who died from renal insufficiency, revealed that her heart was enlarged, the cusps of the aortic valve were thickened, dense and had thrombotic superpositions. The kidneys were motley, enlarged. Microscopically, there were hematoxylin bodies in the epithelial nuclei, the basal membranes of capillaries of the glomeruli were thickened and gave an appearance of wire loops, somewhere the capillaries contained hyaline thrombi and foci of fibrinoid necrosis. Make a diagnosis.

A clinical examination of a 39-year-old male patient revealed some deformity in small joints of her extremities. A microscopic examination of a biopsy of the synovial coat revealed foci of mucoid and fibrinoid swelling and fibrinoid necrosis in the stroma of villi and vascular walls, proliferation of synoviocytes, a perivascular infiltration by lymphocytes, plasmacytes and neutrophils. Which of the diagnoses listed below was the most probable?
rheumatoid arthritis (stage 1)
polyarthritic form of rheumatism
rheumatoid arthritis (stage ii)
rheumatoid arthritis (stage iii)

During autopsy of the body of the 51-years-old woman died because of renal failure the following changes have been found: enlarged parti-colored kidneys, thickening of capillaries’ membranes of glomeruli like “wire loops”, foci of fibrinoid necrosis of their walls and hyaline thrombi in their lumen, “hematoxylin bodies” in nuclei.
